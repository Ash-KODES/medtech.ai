                In India, healthcare systems are grappling with the consequences
                of existing communicable and noncommunicable means of meeting
                people's needs. The failure of public health to make adequate
                progress on these underlying social determinants of health has
                been recognised as a glaring failure. The lack of availability
                of resources in one place and in an organised manner has led to
                several patients left untreated for their symptoms. Our main aim
                is to bring together a platform that bridges this gap between
                the healthcare system and the people.
